#Flask

Flask is a __micro web framework__ written in [Python](/wiki/Python). It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no _database abstraction layer_, _form validation_, or any other components where pre-existing third party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask support extensions that _can add application features_ as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exists for _object-relational mappers_, _form validation_, _upload handling_, as well as various _open authentication technologies_.
