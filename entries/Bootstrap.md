# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open source [CSS](/wiki/Css) framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It was originally named _Twitter Blueprint_ and was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at **Twitter** as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools.

Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of web pages. The primary purpose of adding it to a web project, is to apply Bootstrap's choice of _color_, _size_, _font_ and _layout_ to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find Bootstrap's choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all [HTML](/wiki/Html) elements. Edited.
